                <h2>The Phone Itself <em>(Duh)</em> </h2>
                <p>Samsung's flagship phone is the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. 
                    Samsung has many phones in its basket but the S23 Ultra is the phone that does it all.
                We are going to be discussing the power of the phone, the display, the cameras, the battery life, the sound,
            the S-Pen, the operating software, the features, the unlocking methods, and the accessories.</p>

            <h2>Powerhouse of a Phone</h2>
            <p>This phone is a <b><em> beast </em></b>. It has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, and it gets a Geekbench
                 1500s Single-core score and a Geekbench 4700s Multi-Core Score which is crazy for a 
                 phone. The phone gets a download speed of 450 mbps and 185 mbps while close to the 5GHz internet router which ensures you can finish tasks in a breeze.
                 Overall, the phone works pretty smoothly and you don't have to worry
                about lagging, glitching, and long loading times. </p>

                <h2> The Vibrant, Smooth Display</h2>

                <p>The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra has the best screen in a 
                    smartphone. It is equipped with a 6.8", Dynamic AMOLED 2X, HDR10+ display which 
                    looks amazing and it doesn't suck up the battery life.
                    It has up to a 1440p screen resolution and 501 pixels per inch with
                a max of 120 Hz and it can go down to 1hz. It also has a 1750 nits  peak brightness 
            which allows you to see at any time of day. It is a curved screen
        with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 which can withstand many falls. Overall this screen is the best in a smartphone.</p>

        <h2>The Bizzare Cameras</h2>
        <p>The S23 Ultra has bizzare cameras with a 200mp main and wide camera, 
            a 10mp periscope camera, a 10mp telephoto with 10x optical zoom and 100x max space zoom,
        a 12mp ultrawide camera, and a 12mp selfie camera. The 200mp camera is really great and takes in so much detail, the only bad thing about it is how slow it is to save images and how much space the photos take. The 10mp telephoto camera is great for reading things
    from very far away. Overall, the cameras are great and you can replace your professional camera with
the S23 Ultra for a fraction of the price without risking the quality of the shots. Some examples of the S23 Ultra's photos are under.</p> <br>
