                <h2>The Phone Itself (Duh)</h2>
                <p>Samsung's flagship phone is the the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra. 
                    Samsung has many phones in it's basket but the S23 Ultra is the phone that does it all.
                We are going to be discussing the power of the phone, the display, the battery life, the sound,
            the S-Pen, the cameras, the operating software, features, and the unlocking meathods.</p>

            <h2>Powerhouse of a Phone</h2>
            <p>This phone is a beast. It has Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, and it gets a Geekbench
                 1500s Single-core score and a Geekbench 4700s Multi-Core Score which is crazy for a 
                 phone. The phone gets a download speed of 450 mbps and 185 mbps while close to the 5GHz internet router which ensures you can finish tasks in a breeze.
                 Overall, the phone works pretty smoothly and you don't have to worry
                about lagging, glitching, and long loading times. </p>
